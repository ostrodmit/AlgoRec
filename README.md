# Efficient Algorithms for Adaptive Signal Denoising

Matlab reproducible experiments from the following paper:

Dmitrii Ostrovskii, Zaid Harchaoui. Efficient First-Order Algorithms for Adaptive Signal Denoising. 

We use AdaFilter codes for the efficient implementation of adaptive signal denoising, including them as a submodule.
