# Efficient Algorithms for Adaptive Signal Denoising

Matlab reproducible experiments from the following preprint:

Dmitrii Ostrovskii, Zaid Harchaoui. Efficient First-Order Algorithms for Adaptive Signal Denoising. 

We use [**AdaFilter**](https://github.com/ostrodmit/AdaFilter) codes for the efficient implementation of adaptive signal denoising, including them as a submodule.

We also use [**CVX**](http://cvxr.com/cvx/) software for disciplined convex programming.

## Installation

1. Make sure that CVX is installed on your computer (commercial license is not needed). CVX installation instructions can be found [here](http://cvxr.com/cvx/doc/install.html).
2. Download or clone the repository, and add the following path in **MATLAB**:
```
AlgoRec/AdaFilter/code
```

## Running the experiments
